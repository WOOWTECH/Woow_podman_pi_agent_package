/**
 * Build-time patch: stop silently rewriting Unicode spaces in tool paths.
 *
 * Usage: node fix-unicode-space-paths.mjs <path-utils.js> [more...]
 * The Dockerfile feeds the file list in via find, so this script does not
 * depend on fs.globSync (still experimental on Node 22 — not something an
 * image build should bet on).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Upstream folds U+00A0, U+2000-200A, U+202F, U+205F and U+3000 to an ASCII
 * space on EVERY read, write and edit, and the read fallback chain is built
 * from the already-folded path — so the exact path the caller asked for is
 * never tried.
 *
 * Three consequences, all silent, all reproduced on this deployment against
 * both configured models:
 *   1. write/edit land at a different path than requested, while the success
 *      message is built from the ORIGINAL path — "Successfully wrote 10 bytes
 *      to 新建　檔案.txt" against a file that does not exist.
 *   2. read of `台灣<U+3000>報告.txt` misses the real file.
 *   3. worst: with `Q1<U+3000>報告.txt` and `Q1<U+0020>報告.txt` both present,
 *      reading the first returns the SECOND file's contents with isError=false.
 *      A confidential/public pair differing only by space type cross-reads.
 *
 * U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE is ordinary in Traditional Chinese and Japanese
 * filenames, so this is not an edge case for a zh-TW deployment.
 *
 * THE FIX
 *
 * Folding becomes a READ-ONLY FALLBACK — someone pasting a path with a
 * non-breaking space from a web page still gets a hit — but the exact path is
 * tried first, and writes are never rewritten.
 *
 * pi-web ships two different path-utils implementations (pi-agent-core's
 * harness tools, and pi-coding-agent's core tools). Both fold. Each gets its
 * own hunk set below; a file matching neither shape fails the build rather
 * than being skipped, so an upstream refactor cannot silently drop this fix.
 *
 * Patching compiled output inside node_modules is not something to do lightly.
 * It is done here because the alternative is shipping known silent data
 * corruption to zh-TW customers while waiting on upstream.
